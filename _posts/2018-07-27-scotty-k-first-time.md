I spent a bunch of the day working on making the Jekyll themes work. In the end, I think they are nice, but not a good place to start for experimenting with HTML and CSS techniques. So, I am going back to the simple formatting--though CSS is still mildly confounding--and I will try to build out from there. 

I may stop from **nothing** again because I am going to crack open a book that I bought a while ago. It's called [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](ttp://a.co/5nOoPlq). It is highly rated on Amazon and, flipping through it, the lessons seem to be pretty clear. We'll see how it plays out.
