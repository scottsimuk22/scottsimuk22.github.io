# Ever Evolving First Post

The interaction between HTML, CSS, and Jekyll is still a bit confusing to me. I understand that my blog posts are written in markdown and that Jekyll turns them into HTML for my blog. But, I am still working out the three dash headers. Speaking of which, maybe I should add one above.

I may stop from **nothing** again because I am going to crack open a book that I bought a while ago. It's called [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](ttp://a.co/5nOoPlq). It is highly rated on Amazon and, flipping through it, the lessons seem to be pretty clear. We'll see how it plays out.
