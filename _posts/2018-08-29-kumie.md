# Kumie.org Is A Thing

I finally registered a domain name for my Github pages. I already have a Wordpress blog at scottkumis.org, so I needed something new. Since my occasional nickname is Kumie (or Kumey, either way, pronounced Koo-mee), I figured I would use that for my more playful website.

I was not sure who to use to get my domain name. A friend recommended that I go with [Namecheap](www.namecheap.com). So that is what I did.

This is something that I think most ten year olds can do. But, since it was my first time, I reserve the right to be proud.
