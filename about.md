# Who Am I?
I am an attorney, musician, and occasional writer.

Technology is my favorite topic, especially when combined with one of the above.

I have a more traditional Wordpress site over at [scottkumis.org](https://www.scottkumis.org).

I also have a weekly (well, I try to be weekly) newsletter called [Benevolent Skynet](https://tinyletter.com/BenevolentSkynet).

Finally, you can find me at my first name dot last name at gmail. Say hello sometime.[^1]

[^1]:I don't know why, but I have always had a huge problem spelling the word "hello." I always want to turn it into "hellow." This makes the first lesson of any coding-related activity awkward. "Hellow World"]
