# About - What I'm Up To Now

I am an attorney, musician, and occasional writer.

Technology is my favorite topic, especially when combined with one of the above.

I have a more traditional Wordpress site at [scottkumis.org](https://www.scottkumis.org).

I also have a weekly (well, I try to be weekly) newsletter called [Benevolent Skynet](https://tinyletter.com/BenevolentSkynet).

I post music in the form of loops (that you can use)--and the occasional full song--on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/algone).

Finally, you can find me at my first name dot last name at gmail.
