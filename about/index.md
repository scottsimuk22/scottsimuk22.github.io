# Who Am I?
I am an attorney, musician, and occasional writer.

Technology is my favorite topic, especially when combined with one of the above.

You can find me at my first name dot last name at gmail. Say hello sometime.[^1]

[^1]:I don't know why, but I have always had a huge problem spelling the word "hello." I always want to turn it into "hellow." This makes the first lesson of any coding-related activity awkward. "Hellow World"]
