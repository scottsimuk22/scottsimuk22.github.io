	<h1>Hi there! I'm Scott Kumis</h1>
	<p>I remember the good old days of Geocities. Everyone could have a homepage. Many of us didn't know shit about html, but that was enough to know how to copy and paste and make little tweaks here and there. This is my attempt at the same. Right now I am tweaking the Jekyll Cayman layout. In time, I may move to something else. Or start again from scratch.

	This seems like a better use of my time then endlessly scrolling through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
