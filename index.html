	<h1>Hi there! I'm Scott Kumis</h1>
	<p>I remember the good old days of Geocities. Everyone could have a homepage. Many of us didn't know shit about html, but that was enough to know how to copy and paste and make little tweaks here and there. This is my attempt at the same. I am already confused.

	This seems like a better use of my time then endlessly scrolling through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
