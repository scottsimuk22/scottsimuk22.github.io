# Scott Kumis's Github Page

I remember the good old days of Geocities. Everyone could have a homepage. Many of us didn't know shit about html, but that was enough to know how to copy and paste and make little tweaks here and there. This is my attempt at the same.

I don't have audacious goals here. Mostly, I'd like a simple responsive site where I can share blog posts, music I have written (probably stored in Soundcloud), and some of my other writing experiments. As I get more confident in my experiments, I hope to create more pages.

At the very least, this seems like a better use of my time then endlessly scrolling through Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
